See BUILD.txt on how to configure and build the software.
Then run './figN.sh' or './tabN.sh' to generate the corresponding figure or table.

Note that a screen size of at least 1000x1000 is required, otherwise the figures may become squashed.

Note that the crust figures (3b, 4b, 11a+c) can be generated with http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/graphics/research/CurveRecon/gathan.tar and the following files (crocodile-conf.gtn, ventilator.gtn, ventilator.gtn, mushroom.gtn) which have been adapted from the respective p2d files by adding a header and line numbers.
